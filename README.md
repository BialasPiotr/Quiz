# Quiz
This programme uses the Open Trivia DB API to retrieve random questions for a quiz. The programme retrieves the questions from the API using HTTP and JSON format, and then displays the questions and answers in the GUI. The programme also stores the correct answers so that the user's response can be checked and the score increased if the answer is correct. When the quiz is completed, the programme displays the result and closes.
